# CUFEPORTAL

(This project is still under development in the early stages!)
CUFEPORTAL is a new way to interact with the official college student portal for Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering.

Using the school's APIs, by reverse engineering them, a new website with a modern design is set up to get the information from the official APIs.
Then using the provided information and refactoring it into a sleek and modern design. With a lot of functionalities added that weren't available before, that would greatly improve the student experience.
